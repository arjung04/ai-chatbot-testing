   - Literary culture (from Proust to contemporary novels) reinforces the value of eloquence and correctness.

### 4. **Generational & Contextual Differences**  
   - Older generations tend to be stricter about grammar, while younger people embrace informal digital communication (e.g., text shortcuts like *""pk""* for *""pourquoi""*).  
   - In casual conversations (spoken French), minor errors are overlooked, but written French (even texts) often adheres to higher standards.

### 5. **Exceptions & Evolving Norms**  
   - Some argue that rigid grammar rules are elitist, and movements advocate for more inclusive language (e.g., gender-neutral *""iel""*).  
   - However, these changes are hotly debated, showing how deeply grammar is tied to identity.

### **Bottom Line:**  
While spoken French can be flexible, **written grammar remains a marker of respect and sophistication**. A French adult might forgive a non-native speaker’s mistakes but will likely notice—and quietly judge—errors from fellow natives.
